# Task/Issue Tracker WebApp for Housemates ðŸ‘»ðŸ™†
*branded as **1ssueTrak***

### Brief Description
This application is a personal project developed to help housemates (or people living under the same roof) manage their shared responsibilities, finances and (most importantly) **1ssues**!

1ssues are what we all have to encounter every single day, and while it seems like the more the merrier, things can be quite messy without proper coordination, *especially when mutual respect is not given...*

*thus the birth of this application*

### Core functionalities
1ssuetrak allows users to perform certain tasks to work with shared **Issues**, a central concept of the app. My philosophy of house-sharing management is as followed:

> *If an individual in a group encountered a hardship or is in need of solving a problem, or just simply wish to receive a favor from others, they are having a shared `Issue`. As a group, we work towards solving such issue, then be compensated by returned favors, and not by other means.*

The app allows users (`IssueOwner`) to:
- Post their own `Issue`, so they can be *shared* amongst the group
- CRUD operations on such `Issue`
- Help solve others' `Issue` and receive `PS` (Participation Solvency)
- With excess `PS`, one can post `Issue` to the Issue Board that offers a pre-determined amount of `PS` that one would see fit. The solver of such `Issue` will receive that much amount from the `IssueOwner`
